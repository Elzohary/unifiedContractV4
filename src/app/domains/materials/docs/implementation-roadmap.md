# Materials Management System - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation roadmap for transforming the current materials catalog into a comprehensive Materials Management System with full integration across all modules.

## Current State Analysis

### Work Order Integration
- Materials are assigned to work orders with two types: Purchasable and Receivable
- Complex tracking includes delivery, usage, returns, and wastage
- Multiple dialogs handle different material operations
- Activity logging tracks all material movements

### Materials Module
- Currently functions as a basic catalog system
- Client-specific materials (SEC, Others)
- Basic CRUD operations
- Simple work order assignment

## Architecture Overview

### Core Models Created
1. **inventory.model.ts** - Comprehensive inventory management
   - Warehouse locations and stock tracking
   - Material movements and transfers
   - Stock reservations and adjustments
   - Material requisitions with approval workflow

2. **procurement.model.ts** - Supplier and purchase order management
   - Supplier profiles with performance metrics
   - Purchase orders with approval workflow
   - Delivery tracking and quality checks
   - Price quotations and evaluations

3. **usage-tracking.model.ts** - Cross-entity usage tracking
   - Material usage records across all entities
   - Usage analytics and predictions
   - Material allocations and transfers
   - Usage alerts and anomaly detection

### Core Services
1. **material-integration.service.ts** - Central integration hub
   - Track material usage across all entities
   - Check availability before assignment
   - Reserve materials for future use
   - Generate usage analytics and alerts

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### State Management
- Use ViewModels for complex UI state
- Implement RxJS for reactive data flow
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Implement optimistic updates

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy load material modules
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Use pagination for historical data
- Optimize search with debouncing

### Security Considerations
- Role-based access control for operations
- Audit trail for all material movements
- Approval workflows for high-value items
- Data encryption for sensitive information

### Integration Standards
- RESTful API design for backend
- Consistent error handling
- Standardized response formats
- Comprehensive logging

## Migration Strategy

### Data Migration
1. Export existing material assignments
2. Map to new data structures
3. Validate data integrity
4. Import with rollback capability

### Backward Compatibility
1. Maintain existing work order functionality
2. Gradual feature rollout
3. Feature flags for new capabilities
4. Parallel run period
