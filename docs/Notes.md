Great Questions to answer:

Domain Models Details:
For the Work Order model, what specific properties should it have? (e.g., title, description, status, start date, end date, etc.)
For Tasks, what properties should they include? (e.g., name, description, status, priority, etc.)
For Items (activities), what properties should they have? (e.g., description, quantity, unit price, etc.)
For Manpower, what information do you need to track? (e.g., person details, role, daily rate, etc.)
For Equipment, what properties should be included? (e.g., equipment type, daily rate, etc.)
Business Rules:
What are the specific business rules for creating/updating/deleting work orders?
Are there any validation rules for the different entities?
Are there any specific calculations needed (e.g., total cost calculations)?
What are the workflow states for work orders?
Authentication & Authorization:
What specific permissions should each role have?
Are there any role-specific operations or restrictions?
Additional Requirements:
Do you need any specific reporting features?
Are there any specific performance requirements?
Do you need any integration with external systems?
Are there any specific audit requirements (tracking changes, etc.)?
Technical Preferences:
Do you have a preference for the .NET version (e.g., .NET 8)?
Do you want to use any specific design patterns (e.g., Repository Pattern, Unit of Work)?
Do you have any specific requirements for logging or error handling?
Do you need any specific caching mechanisms?




Looking at the dotNetProject.md file, I notice the following modules are specified:

1. **Main Modules**:
   - Work Order Module
   - Resources Management Module
   - HR Module
   - Authentication Module
   - User Management Module

2. **Sub-Modules under Resources Management**:
   - Material Management
   - Equipment Management
   - Manpower Management

Let me revise the architecture to better reflect these modules:

Key Implementation Details for Each Module:

1. **Work Order Module**:
   - Work Order CRUD operations
   - Tasks management
   - Items (activities) tracking
   - Expenses tracking
   - Permits management
   - Remarks system
   - Issues tracking
   - Photos and attachments
   - Forms management
   - Invoices handling

2. **Resources Management Module**:
   - Material Management:
     - Receivable materials
     - Purchasable materials
     - Inventory tracking
     - Material assignments
   
   - Equipment Management:
     - Equipment tracking
     - Equipment assignments
     - Maintenance records
   
   - Manpower Management:
     - Employee assignments
     - Time tracking
     - Role management

3. **HR Module**:
   - Employee management
   - Role management
   - Department management
   - Attendance tracking
   - Performance management

4. **Authentication Module**:
   - JWT implementation
   - Role-based access control
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Token management

5. **User Management Module**:
   - User CRUD operations (admin only)
   - Role assignments
   - Permission management
   - User profile management

Each module will have:
- Its own domain models
- Application services
- Repository implementations
- API controllers
- DTOs
- Validators
- Unit tests

Would you like me to proceed with creating this structure and implementing the initial setup? I'll start with:

1. Creating the solution and projects
2. Setting up the core domain models for each module
3. Implementing the database context with proper relationships
4. Setting up authentication and authorization
5. Creating the basic API structure for each module

Please let me know if you want me to proceed or if you'd like to make any adjustments to the proposed architecture based on the modules.
